electronics,3 of 4,1.0,keep looking,"I had this 6 months (which is how long it takes to figure out how to use it!) and the backlight is no longer working. So I can't see the time, without a flashlight or lamp",0
electronics,8 of 8,2.0,Love affair gone sour,"I have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor.",0

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Jamming Piece o' Junk!,I bought this machine based on the good reviews I found here. I have had it for one month and it does nothing but jam.  Now the two week return policy at the store has expired and I am left with a jamming piece o' junk.,0
electronics,1 of 6,1.0,Mouse? What Mouse,"Amazon does not ship to Post Office Boxes.  The mouse could ONLY be shipped to a post office box per Amazon shipping proticol.  Therefore, after TWO attempts to purchace this product from Amazon I had to buy elsewhere.  If you live where the United States Postal Service does not deliver the mail to your house, pass of this item if not Amazon.  I have considerable expierance buying mail order and online and this is the first time I have found a company setting rules that actually prevent the buyer from recieving the product",0
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,People complain too much,"Hey, don't listen to those other schmucks. So maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable, but the rest just complain too much. I love this thing! I got it for Christmas, and now for $20, you can't beat that. I use a standard charger for it in my car, so I never have to worry about batteries. It seems that the best way to get it to sound the best, is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using (equalizer). I have also used it on my portable DVD player in the car and it sounds awesome! For the price, I highly recommend this product",1
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,lousy phone,Surprisingly poor quality for a Uniden phone.  Volume is very low -- hard to hear caller.  Don't waste your money. ,0
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Can't find the timer for the radio,I'd really like to know how I listen to the radio at night and have it shut off in an hour and then have the alarm go off when I need it. I thought that's what a radio was supposed to do,0
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The Best!!!,"I've owned these Altec's for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!",1
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,perfect headphones for urban dwellers who use mass transit,"I chose these by reading other reviews on Amazon.  I am pleased with them and recommend them. Good sound, light weight.  The best feature is that they do NOT leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you.  This is perfect for an ipod-using NYC subway rider.   Don't want to annoy others by leaking sound, but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise, at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what's going on.",1
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Expanded Memory for Motorola RAZR V3m for Verizon,"The SanDisk 1GB Micro SD Card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging.  I installed it in my Motorala RAZR V3m as expanded memory for my music library.  Be sure to remove the RAZR battery to clear the access slot for the Micro SD.  The V3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems.  I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access ""My Music"" using menu function #3 under ""Get Tunes & Tones"".  Function #6 ""Manage Music"" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.  The SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the V3m as cell phone with ""MP3"" player",1

electronics,16 of 20,2.0,Did not perform as advertised,"This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that",0

electronics,2 of 2,2.0,you get what you pay for,"subwoofer should not be called that: it's tiny, and distorts if the slightest bass is put through it. Not good for music, not good for gaming. Steer clear",0
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A great porduct,The Microsoft optical wheel mouse is a great product. It is worth every penny of the purchase price. A great value! It is so much better than my old mouse with the ball in it. The optical wheel mouse is much more accurate too. The best purchase I ever made,1

electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Buzz in microphone,"Amazon quickly shipped this item to me and I was ready to rock 'n' roll -- until I plugged it in.  There was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear.  The buzzing noise stopped when I hit mute, so the Plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem.  Amazon was very gracious about their return policy and I was quickly sent a new phone free of charge.  Well, the second phone does the same thing and I'm returning it to get a refund.  Maybe just my phone line?  Possibly.  But I've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both",0

electronics,17 of 19,4.0,Cobra 4500,"The unit operates as good as any other GPS system available, plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches.  I am very impressed with the GPS, but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed.  The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily.  The unit deserves a five star rating, but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided.",1

electronics,,1.0,Quit working after printing three pages successfully,Confusing light display (looking in the manual) told me there was a paper jam after printing three pages.  There is no jam. There is nothing stuck in the printer.  Sending it back now.  I do not have time to troubleshoot a new printer that fails to work properly after three pages.  (Maybe you won't have time either!)

electronics,10 of 14,5.0,Love satellite radio,"I got this for hubby and me over the summer.   We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it.   WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor.  We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter.   ",1
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,Slingbox first and second impressions.,"The idea is excellent, the execution is flawed.  What is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home.  The adapter should be built into the box. ",1
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,"cord is so short, uncomfotable to try and use.","I am not using this Microphone, the cord from the back of my computer barely reaches. Uncomfortable to lean so far forward",0
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,awesome speakers!,"Again, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    ",1
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,I love them,These ear buds are great for people with small ears.  I've tried several and these are by far the best.  It comes with 3 sizes of buds and the smallest work best for me,1
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Perfect for your laptop,I'm a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.,1
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Garbage!,"To back up my personal DVD collection I burned 200 discs.  100 on these Memorex DVD+R's, 100 on Philips DVD+R's.  EVERY Memorex had flaws during playback.  EVERY Philips was flawless.  I've been buying Memorex for years but I'll never buy Memorex again",0
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Fast and does what it should,"A simple, cheap investment.  This CF reader actually does what it should, i.e. transfer info from compact flash to the computer.  Previous Kodak 1.0 multi-card reader had issues after a few weeks, and stopped working after 2 months.  This one is much faster and is still working.  Ahhhhh",1
electronics,,5.0,Wors great but should be able to upgrade/trade in,"Box worked perfectly as expected. However, it would be nice to be able to upgrade firmware to the new HD like performance or via a trade-in program to allow old customers to upgrade to the new Sling boxes",1
electronics,3 of 7,1.0,The slide lock key is too weak,"I bought it last april and i didnt realize that slide lock key was too weak, and now I try to write data but a message is about the data is secure (locked)",0
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Not Reliable and Customer Service is Poor,"Everything your read about the picture quality is true... however, this product just isn't reliable.  Cost me another $600 to get it fixed and it isn't even 18 months old. I am sure I am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues.  Customer service from this company is also very poor. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased this product and I probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed. I think it will be just a matter of time before some of these 5 star reviews begin to change their tune",0
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,FM transmitter,It broke after two uses.  It has an auto shutoff if no detection after 30 seconds and I plugged it in to everything and it would shut off every 30 seconds.  I was so mad I threw it out the window.  What a waste of thirty bucks,0
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Useless - does not retract,"I agree with the previous review.  This phone cord worked twice.  Now, it only retracts about half way, and keeps getting worse.  I'm returning it for a refund.  Don't waste your time with this",0
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Monitor,"I had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up...but after a little tweaking, it works beautifully.  Previously owned regular CRT...what an improvement!  Superb clarity and brightness.  For the money you just can't go wrong with this one",1

electronics,0 of 1,1.0,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Everyone knows TERK MAKES JUNK, and this multiswitch is no exception. I needed a multiswitch quick, went to Best Buy and paid, get this, $154.00 for this Terk ms!! Yeah, I know, but I needed it asap. ONE WEEK after installation, one of the satellite inputs crapped out, dead. And I do have surge protection on the lines. Also, the unit runs very hot. I've had three other Terk products do the same thing. Avoid Terk at all costs and go with Monster or even Radio Shack in a pinch. Will never buy a Terk product again. Ever",0
electronics,5 of 8,1.0,Midland GTX600VP4 Radios Bogus - Midland Bogus,"Using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe.  The distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration, just as it would be between a bike and a car.",0

electronics,,4.0,Wonderful Keyboard,"This is the second G15 keyboard I've purchased, not because the first one broke, because it's such a great keyboard. Now I keep one at home, and take one with me when I go LANning.  The only issue with the keyboard is the LCD is pretty useless is fast paced FPS games, otherwise it's good for keeping the clock up so one doesn't lose track of the time",1
electronics,28 of 33,2.0,Like a Porsche... without wheels!,"When realtime traffic monitoring came to my city, I immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife's daily business driving (2-500 miles weekly, crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes). I quickly settled on an automotive GPS with realtime traffic monitoring. There are not yet many choices in this area, so the options boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720. (These use FM radio for the traffic info; the XM-radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since I don't want XM radio.)",0

electronics,1 of 4,1.0,Buyer Beware,"All ports began running slow after just 6 months of use. Followed LinkSys RMA process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake. I followed yet another LinkSys RMA process and had to wait TWO MONTHS for the replacement switch covering their mistake. The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues",0
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,Blah sound overall,"I was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews, however, I have been extremely disappointed in them.  I may have had too high of expectations, but these things put out NO bass whatsoever (it just sounds muffled and cruddy), and the overall sound is extremely poor.  I'm really surprised as I've owned JBL speakers in my car that I was extremely pleased with, so I'm amazed at the lacking quality in these.  I would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included",0
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Was not recognizeable,these were not recognizable by my Sony Dual layer burner... maybe with more attempts and practice they will be,0
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent LCD!,"Researched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32"" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   ",1
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good little speakers!,"I am very happy with this product. It folds super slim, so traveling with it is a breeze! Pretty good sound - not Bose quality, but for the price, very respectable! I've had it almost a year, and it has been along on many weekend get-aways, and works great. I use it alot, so it was a good purchase for me",1
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Unacceptable.  This is worse than Beta.,"I bought this a few weeks ago so that I could connect a cordless phone to my office computer and use Skype for my calling.  When it works, it works well, and the sound quality is fine.  Unfortunately, much of the time, it doesn't work.  It drops calls at random.  Customer support is dismal, I emailed them several days ago and didn't even get a response acknowledging the email, let alone a solution to my problem.  Just now I have tried reinstalling the drivers but that seems to be failing.  ",0
electronics,8 of 20,1.0,Not what I thought,"  This product is not very good.  There is no display on the TV, just a black screen.  The remote, which is just a pause button anyways with no menu functions, does not make a difference because you are unable to see your small Ipod screen from far away.  The overall video quality is quite low, even with an s-video cable",0
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,Won't return money,"Adorama is a terrible company to deal with. They sent me a pkg of 2 Epson ink cartridges and 270 papers.  I have called several times as the ink cartridges were not the correct ones. I returned them as instructed, written 3 letters and called. This started in mid July.  I called 2 weeks ago (Aug 28th and a different gal said she thought I should have my money back and would see to it.  That was over 2 weeks ago and nothing since then.  ",0
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,"Love the concept, hate the product!","I think this product design concept is great.  I love the flexibe arm size.  It fits great in my car.  The CRAPPY part.  I live near metro st. louis and i could not hold a signal ANYWHERE!  I always had some intereference.  whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out.  This product did not meet my expectations, especially since the back of the package states I should have crystal clear sound.  This is not true.  I have returned this product after little success over the first week of purchase.  I am now waiting to get my DLO transpod 2 in the mail to try it out.  I want something to work!",0
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Strongly recommended,Kingston's 2GB Data Traveler USB drive is perfect to storage files. I have looked for a 2 GB USB and found this one to be the cheapest based on its characteristices. I think it is a bargain price,1

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,You get what you pay for with these speakers.,"These 2.0 speakers sound great (and not just for their size), are adjustable, small, and good looking. I'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when I turned the volume up so I could understand human speech. I'm happy I spent the money. These are real quality in my opinion",1
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,amazing for the value,When i first came across this particular microphone i had my doubts. Considering the price of it i just couldn't see it holding up for what i wanted to do. to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations.

electronics,,1.0,Cheap & Buggy,"The features, size, and design of this unit are what drew me in. But after just a few uses, I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive, but completely unusable package. To start with, the unit is small - the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second, the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So, when it crashes, which it does frequently, there is no way to ""cold-boot"" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then, what you have is a paperweight. Oh, and by the way, when you do have it plugged in to charge, the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either.",0

electronics,,5.0,"My last ""jump drive""","I had a small 512 Sandisk a while back, so when I saw a review for the Titanium 2GB Cruzer in a popular computer mag, I decided to upgrade from my Lexar 1GB.  So far, I'm very impressed.  Just did a 1.26GB transfer that took 140 seconds.  I was a big leery of the included software, but was pleased to see that if I didn't care for it, it was easily removed.  I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive, and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract.  This is a very good drive, and contrary to the negative comments, I would encourage anyone looking for a fast, stylish, practical jump drive to seriously conside the Titanium Cruzer",1
electronics,8 of 11,1.0,Back-UPS ES drops power AFTER power is restored!,"Most people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works.

electronics,4 of 5,5.0,"Inexpensive, Great Performer, Outstanding Value","I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12"" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!         ",1

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Antenna works OK, Garmin needs a better antenna plug","The antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the GPS units internal antenna. This easily solved the issue of poor reception when the GPS is inside of a car; however, the best accuracy I am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs. the 9 feet using the GPS's internal antenna when in an open area.  Garmin's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around (on my GPS).  I feel the antenna was worth purchasing",1
electronics,,4.0,VHS TO DVD AND IPOD,VHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect,1
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,NOT SO GREAT AS THEY SAY.JUST OK,These radios look nice but there are some problems here. First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk. Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands. The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times. I also hace a T7200 and the difference is like night and day. The 7200 is the best. The 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low. I paid $24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for $44.00 today. What good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying? Good try motorola but this is a poor product.NOT RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE,0
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Chinese made Junk - save your money!,"I was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has.

But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.

I think they are really just on/off switches disguised as variable dials, because i don't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels. I'm going to now go to a REAL, serious electronics store and look for some SERIOUS tv electronics hardware instead of Wallmart garbage. I'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and I'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if I can find one (a high quality one, not junk). I tried a preamp from Wallmart (which wasn't adjustable at all) and it did help a lot with UHF channels, but the VHF channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong. So I need a variable gain preamp, assuming there is such a thing.

electronics,30 of 31,5.0,A Top-Notch Universal DVD Player,"There's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&LOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is ""no bass management,"" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting ""small"" or ""large"" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit ""will NOT play DVD-Audio discs."" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For ""pure"" DVD-A's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A's, and so displays only the ""jacket image"" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you'll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features",1

electronics,4 of 7,1.0,Technical Details Misleading,"It states in the Technical Details that you can get 450 pictures from this cartridge. This is not true.  After much discussion with HP, they finally admitted that it's only rated for 150 4 x 6 pictures.  My experience is that you actually get a little under 100 pictures from it.  If you're buying this cartridge, you've probably already bought the printer, but you should know before you buy the printer that you're going to go through a lot of expensive ink",0

The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.

This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it's worth that.  It's a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.

Like other reviews you see here, people started not being able to hear me, but I could hear them. So the microphone broke. But, I called Uniden tech support and they recommended I replace the battery on the phone for $37. So, I just ordered a new phone and tested the headset -- sure enough it wasn't the phone -- it was the headset. A costly mistake. I would not buy this headset again. Also, Amazon has a 30 day return policy, so if it breaks, make sure you return it within that 30 days or you are stuck with it",0

This is the latest upgrade and it is the worst unit I have ever used.  It works great for about 3 or 4 months on average.  After that, the voice unit stops working.  I can hear others speaking to me but no one can hear me.  I have gone through 4 of these units in 13 months and the longest lived unit lasted &lt; 5 months.  One broke after &lt; 2 months.

electronics,1 of 2,2.0,Awesome when it worked,"I really enjoyed my Zen, when it worked.  The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop.  So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space.  I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days.  Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems.  It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it",0

I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.",1

Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can't use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now.

electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Bad sounding headphones!,"I've been a fan of Sony earbuds for many years.  Due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest Sony earbuds, I decided on purchasing these Panasonic headphones. I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones.  I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs.  I've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings.  It's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise.  I like the around the neck feature.  As far as quality, the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it.  As far as the performance of the headphones, I'm really disappointed in these headphones.  My factory Creative headphones had out performed these.  The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player.  The mids and treble sound like crap. Don't waste your money on these!  Now I have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones!  argh!",0
electronics,14 of 14,4.0,Not bad at all!,"I have some decent mics in my cabinet, as well as a nice preamp, A/D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup.  I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.  Way to go, Samson",1

THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull.  First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple, huh?  Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%.  I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it",1

The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated.  I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis.  Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod????",0

electronics,13 of 19,1.0,Not Good,"I bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so",0

electronics,18 of 20,1.0,Worthless!!!,"I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said &quot;it IS ON!!&quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing",0

Plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they STILL work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance.

(I packed and returned the unit the day after getting home.) It may suit others well, but I can not rely on the unit. Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences. (One wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way.)Two were for unknown reasons. The unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites.

In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.

electronics,,1.0,Software defeats purpose of flash drives.,"After having an experience with slow startup speeds (and actually freezing a computer) with the 1GB Cruzer Micro with U3, I feel compelled to write this negative review. The mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives: a fast and higlhly compatible interface. Any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability. I work at an educational institution wher I am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive. As a matter of policy, we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background",0

Portability is not much of a need, I plan on being around a power outlet. The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it's about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal.

The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung's own 20.1"" non-widescreen model).

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Very good standard SD card at an excellent price!,"I recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     ",1

electronics,29 of 36,1.0,"Does not work, bad service","The DVD burner connected very easily through USB, was immediately recognized by WinXP, the software installation was fine. I was beginning to feel good. However, whenever I burned a DVD (I tried 4 different brands, some R, some RW etc...), several files would contain errors, and would be completely unreadable. The burning process moreover does not detect this: one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors. Moreover, the firmware update just does not work on my machine, pardon, machineS. Completely standard Dell machines, all latest WinXP and drivers, good CPUs (3Ghz and up), lots of memory, big hard-drives. I called customer service to try to solve the problem. First of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes. The rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing. To make a long story short, I had to call 3 times. First guy: oh, ""of course it doesn't work, you have EasyCD creator installed!"". Ok, I buy it, I go through the (painful) uninstallation process of Roxio's software. No problems solved. Second guy: ""Oh, of course it does not work, it requires 10Gb of free hard-drive space! It's written on the box"". Plain lie: on the box it says you need 10Gb for NeroVision (for burning videos), but only 1Gb for Nero. Quarrel (they are tough!) with the guy who could not care less about the fact I got him lying, or that the product description is wrong. Ok, patiently I freed up 10Gb from hard drive, try again, exactly same problem. The only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement. I got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720, not a 710, since 710 is not manufactured anymore (wonder why?).

I knew there was nothing wrong the router or internet because I inserted my old Belkin adapter and it connected straight away!,0

Here was my solution, Since the TS105B has the 2.5mm port for a headset, I purchased a Jabra A210 Bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office. So far... WOW!!! its worked out great. The phone is also good by itself, plus it was inexpensive through AMAZON. For anyone interested in going the route I took... you will not be disappointed. ",1

All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren't the greatest phones I've ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I've ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn't grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g",1

electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Great AM reception -- assume you'll be buying new earphones,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet.  If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you've found the right radio for you.  I can't tell you how many pieces of junk I've bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio",1

Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.",1

electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Good sound... SUCKS for iPOD!!!,"The ONLY reason i bought this unit when I saw it in the store was for the iPod controller feature.  I really looked forward to being able to control my iPod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight.  Boy was I disappointed!  The iPod adpater works and all... but barely.  It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs, artists or albums.  Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you can't even select songs from the iPod itself?  I have over 3000 songs on my iPod... by the time I scroll to the song I want I've already reached my destination... and that's if I even find the song at all!  So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod, scroll to the song I want, then plug it back in. (Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in.)  But again... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck.  Bottom line, the iPod control feature flat SUCKS.  The deck features a ""quick search"" function... but it is uselss... it isn't used to search through artsts or albums... only individual songs and there's no way to skip 10, 20, 30 or 100 songs at a time... only 1 by 1... What's ""quick"" about that?   I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1???? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing, the display just says ""song up"" or ""song down"" instead of just showing the name of the damn song!  Who thought of that?  What possible help could ""song up"" be to anyone? Just show the name of the song while I'm skipping through... that makes more sense right?  There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing... but then again... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to",0

electronics,8 of 8,1.0,I HATE IT,"I hate this contraption and I stupidly let 30 days pass before I realized how much I hate it. Now I start every morning with a ""boy I hate this thing.""  Why? well here are few reasons why: You cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18"" and to get a backlight you must depress ""any button""---not a bad idea but horribly executed.  The backlight lasts four seconds--way too fast in the night and ""any button"" is a lie because you can't press ""stop"" nor the ""on"" for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then, in the dark, have to figure out how to terminate.  The cd player spends more time ""reading"" your cd than it does playing it.  The ""tuner/band"" button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to, the screech of a not tuned in AM station happens way too often.  The worst of it all was I called Eton to tell them how much I hated it, just thought they might want to know. I had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something, but first she wanted me to talk to the engineer/designer.  So I waited a week for him to return my call and he was quite rude saying if there is nothing wrong with it (everything is wrong, but they don't count that) there is nothing they can do.

This system here isn't much money, so it isn't going to be the best. So there isn't no reason for the bad reviews. I think they work really good for the price their tagged at.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,HP 50G Review Comments,The 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about  0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970's series of the HP hand held calculators,1

Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98.

electronics,12 of 26,1.0,One-third the features for three-quarters of the price,"My wife bought this as a gift for me, thinking that it included an FM tuner. For ten dollars more, she could have purchased a product that does everything this one does (it is essentially a $35 car charger) plus the tuner.  If you want to use this product to actually listen to your iPod in your car, you'll need to purchase yet another device: either the cassette adapter (old school! part F8V366-APL) or the FM transmitter (part F8V367-APL).  Either one connects through a jack in the side of this unit.  The FM transmitter is another $40 (you're now $20-30 over what the Monster iCarPlay, which does all of the above, would have cost you)...and, surprise!  The transmitter takes AAA batteries!  There's no way to power the transmitter through the Auto Kit.  To power the FM transmitter without batteries, you must purchase yet a third accessory, the ""Mobile Power Cord for iPod"" (F8V7067-APL, just $15!)...except your car's power plug is occupied by the Auto Kit, so you'll need to buy a twin-plug adapter for that.",0

When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package.

The first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them. Stay away from this printer at all costs.

electronics,3 of 7,2.0,Poor build quality,"Great sound, but the build quality is just not there.  On a recent trip to Europe, the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver.  They are only two months old and I always keep them in the case!  I had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together.  Since then I've also had to superglue the right bud as well.  Also, the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead, revealing the fine speaker wire underneath.  I don't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad.  They are great sounding and comfortable, but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners.  Be warned",0
electronics,,4.0,A good accessory for your iPod,I purchased my iTrip about 4 months ago and now can give an objective review of the product.  The iTrip is a good choice over competitors' products and offers a good value for the money.  Radio reception is good; I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That's mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.  ,1

I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around.

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Quality Cable,"I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore",1

If you plan on leaving your computer on for extended periods of time and then coming back to it to do some work you may find that your scroll wheel no longer scrolls pages. I have had to on several occasions unplug and replug in my mouse in order to get the scroll wheel working again. This is absolutely UNEXCEPTIBLE Logitech! What happened to Logitech?

electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Short lived performance,"I bought the TDK Mojo 256 about a year and 3 months ago. It worked wonderfully for the first year - did what it was supposed to and the radio quality was great. Then I upgraded to Windows XP and that's when everything started going wrong. This MP3 player needs propreitary software to copy files from your hard disk or CD to the mp3 player. Unfortunately the software doesn't work well at all with XP. Right now, my player is piece of junk. I have tried copying files which it shows as copied but then when you reconnect the player, they don't show up on there. What's more, formatting the internal memory will also not release the space and so I have the internal memory full but it shows up in the software as free. However, it won't copy over any new files and gives me a ""Storage Full"" error. It doesn't act reliably with XP either and I had to unplug and replug several times for it to even read the list of songs on the mp3. It lasted all of 15 months. While it sounds like a great deal ( good features for price ). DO NOT buy this if you will be using it with XP and if you do, please don't expect it to last more than 12-15 months",0
electronics,7 of 8,2.0,"Nice idea, but...",...while this device does power your USB cable it seems to fail charging my Blackberry or my iPod. Maybe the 400 mA is not enough for that.

I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to ""mold"" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.

At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on ""headphones"" and played ""Metallica- Nothing else matters"" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general.

However, I value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit I received last week.  It inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed.  So, if you're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything?  No.  You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page.  In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine's overall utility.  Swing a little bit harder next time Fujitsu",0

A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.

The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car.

There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it.  Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions! I will attempt to return this item",0

electronics,3 of 8,4.0,Black Ink Anyone?,"There are so many times where the actual ink, can be the difference between a good copy, and a not-so-good copy on paper. With HP black ink cartridge #21, it is very convient, and easy to setup into your HP deskjet 3930 series printer. This cartridge is very inexpensive, and affordable for HP printers. I think of it as a must for your HP printers. While there are cartridges that are difficult to open, and install into your printers, this one installs in a snap. I really recommend this for my new HP printer, and so will you if you own a HP printer for this ink as well.",1

It worked fine in single-user, no encryption mode but that is not what I needed. I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP. One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection, sometimes I had to reboot the laptops, sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101, and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101.

The computer seemed to work for a while or at least had few errors when I first used it but I guess that was when I had windows 98 for 2 years. When I upgraded to windows XP it just got terrible I had frequent blue screens and errors. I thought it was my video card or my ram or Irq sharing tried all that didn't seem to be it.  Eventually I was wrong it was this card as mentioned before by others apparently it does not like some amount of internet use and when the card gets stuck it shuts down and windows xp just says error or points to the video card or irq sharing ot page fault in non page area as the problem.  The card was the problem buy another card other than fa310,fa311 the one I have and fa312 even if you have intel or something else I would not waist my money on this card it will probably give you problems down the road.

It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus",0

Also there have been reports of complete data loss by others,but I've not had that experience - could be I just haven't been able to GET to my data enough to find out.  Support from Lacie was completely unhelpful (wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which I have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion).  If the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion, the failure of biometrics would not be so serious, but as is, I would definitely not purchase this again, and I would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement",0

Yes, they are comfortable, but the bass is almost absent, no matter how far you jam them into your ears, the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be, it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid & hi's they produce. Unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max, I'd recommend another pair of earphones. If you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass, these are your headphones.

It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it.

The pop-up menu thing is cool.  I don't use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place.

I wanted a backpack making company with a name I knew, like Jansport,or Kelty.  I've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products.  I settled on the Kensington because it had the qualities I was seeking: comfort, quality materials and design, water proofing, laptop padding, urban black, rugged exterior, sophisticated appearance, lots of pockets, adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket.  I write and work in media for a living.  Mostly I work at home, but once a week I travel to cities.

I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. ",1

It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.

I've set up other peripherals with success, but this product is more than I can handle. I've followed the directions, over and over, and still the router doesn't connect. I've given up. Can't handle the frustration. By the way, I'm way over the age of 13. I have grandchildren over the age of 13.",0
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Unexpected Awesomeness,I am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys. I bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out. I first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome. i could hear things in songs i have never heard before. I then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like. to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp. There was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good. the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you. I am glad i got these instead of the 650's cause my friend owned the 650's and if you don't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck,1

The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub!

I purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it.  I have had numerous problems with this router since then.  It does not stay connected and there is actually no option for ""always on.""  After having some other problems, I took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware.  After that, it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be re-entered.  Then today, after being instructed to reset the router, it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade (there was no apparent way out of this).  So, I obtained the upgrade and according to the router message, it was updated successfully.  After that, I could not get the router to work at all.  I gave up and ordered an entirely different router (the same brand that I has used before with tremendous success).

A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter",1

Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.

There's no gold inside!  So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables.   If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie.  Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.",0
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Just OK,"One of the reasons I chose this mouse, was because Apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling.  It turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others.  It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add.  Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don't.  Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I'd buy something else",0

The results  were outstanding for a do-it-yourself project. I followed the instructions  included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake. One thing that I  did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact. This product also does a very good job in black and white, not  just in color. The shirts that I did, laundered according to the  instructions, came out of the wash lookin' good.

I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.

electronics,92 of 95,5.0,By Far The Best Multi On The Market Today,"I don't normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that ""quick"" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.

One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However, it doesn't even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  ",1

Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).

IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of &quot;over-the-head&quot; headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price",1

electronics,,4.0,Great all purpose remote,"I have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.",1

The first thing I had to do was upgrade the firmware - no instructions on how to do this, but for the uninitiated: you have to download the .ftp file from Dlink, move it to the Dlink Firmware folder on your computer, then get the AP Manager to see your unit (that's another story involving IP addresses - again, no help from the install documents), and then you can install the update. I finally got the DWL-2100AP to see my network, but never could get it to talk back - it just sent gibberish. The Net tech and I worked on it for most of two working days, to no avail. Spent a lot of time on the phone with the DLink tech staff too, where everyone involved said we got some bad dope from the sales staff, but that we might get it to work, provided it is compatible with the existing equipment blah, blah, blah... My assessment of Dlink and the DLINK DWL-2100AP?

electronics,5 of 8,2.0,Disparate cord length- more than irritating.,"I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones",0

electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Worked at first but....,"I bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be. No more equipment in the tv room! About two weeks ago though, I noticed that the unit was slower and slower and I had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done. It has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all. At first I thought it was batteries in the remote, so I replaced those a few times. Then I thought the placement of the IR transmitter was off, so I moved it closer to my AV rack. That worked at first, but the problem persisted so I reprogrammed, but to no avail. Eventually I narrowed it down to the remote unit. Even with the remote RIGHT NEXT TO THE IR Transmitter, it now does not work most of the time.

The PC interface works well, and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive.  Unfortunately, that in no way translates into a good remote interface.  The ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor, and, for those with video recorder boxes, very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available (if its there at all, its hidden many keystrokes deeper than I care to know about).  Even when reverting to manual operation of individual components, changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes (as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes--a much more irritating trait than one might think).

The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star",1

electronics,,2.0,Disappointed with DPH-50U,"On the good side, it was easy to set up, and worked reasonably well if the phone (tried both cordless and corded) was plugged directly into unit. However, I could not get it to work on other phones in the house when I used the jack to plug it into the wall per the instructions (so it would work like a land line on any phone in the house). I do not have a land line, so it may just need a land line to work since you are supposed to be able to switch back and forth. I even tried disconnecting the line outside the house but that didn't work either. ",0
electronics,,4.0,Decent Phone - I'm Satisfied,"We bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago.  One handset gave us problems from the start, but was promptly replaced when returned for service.  The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.  I like the features, including paging system, call transfer, and handset speakerphone.  Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus.  I think the sound quality is very good, and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive.  I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.",1

When you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from Apple Computer to make it work. Calling Apple, I find that they no longer sell the adapter. When I called Griffin I was surprised to find that if you have any other iPod than Mini and the adapter is not in the box, they will send you one. They recommended that I return the RoadTrip, which is what I did. Save yourself the aggrevation -- if you have an iPod Mini stay away from Griffin Technology",0

Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.

This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac.

However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well.

Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video.

Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).

The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.

It might work if you have a perfectly FLAT dash. I had to return the item as it did not sit properly. Even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down. Those of you who are clean freaks like me, BEWARE. Products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand! I would not trust a $800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down. What about jolts and bumps while normal driving?

The TV is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen.  I didn't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don't have cable.  I tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other.  I tried programming with the antenna on the TV and with separate rabbit ears.   It would only pick up one of the three local network stations.  It picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren't popular.   I couldn't get a good picture on any of the stations and I tried adjusting all the menu items, brightness, hue, etc.  It didn't even have a good black and white picture .... it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back.   Sooooo, sooo disappointed because I wanted to be able to use this at work too. ",0
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Great, uncolored sound","I bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I've owned the Sony MDR-V600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now",1

While operating the Belkin TuneCast II in my car I found that driving over or under bridges, under traffic lights, under power lines, or near large trucks increases the static to a level where the music can not be heard at all. The only way I could get audio clarity equal to that of a dirty and scratched record or a distant AM station was to hold the transmitter to the face of my radio. What a piece of poo!

The printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys.  Took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing.

I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader.

I  called HP and they stated this was a fatal error in the unit and encouraged me to purchase the updated model rather than fix my printer.

I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either.

electronics,13 of 14,4.0,Powerful for the price,"Until an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound, these were my favorite pair of earphones. They were comfortable (I often left them in when I went to sleep), affordable, lightweight, durable, and had good sound quality. I used them with my Sony CFD-V5 boombox, my Oritron OP5034 portable CD player, and my RCA RP2410 MP3-CD player. On all three, bass and detail was great, and there was no distortion at a higher volume. All in all, these earphones were a great value; the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound, which I got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones (it lent a bit of warmth to the music). I plan to buy another pair in the near future, and I highly recommend that you do so as well",1

If you do want to hear music, you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you'll get is static. I bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it. I was hesitant to buy it, seeing almost every review has said it doesn't work but I bought it anyway, don't buy it! Every review I've seen has negative feedback for this item, and I agree with everyone. I figured since Griffin made a new itrip, it would be better and work great. However, it is the total opposite from that. I do NOT recommend this product at all. Don't waste your time or money",0

electronics,2 of 3,5.0,More bang for your buck.,"This is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune.",1
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"As sturdy as it looks, and with very good sound for the price","I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it ""should,"" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.",1
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Three Units in Three Weeks!,"I bought this unit on a wim.  I was leaving for a business trip and needed a GPS.  I really like it and it worked well for me.  Unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery.  So I returned it for another one.  It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem.  Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units.  When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn't work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up.  Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn't have any more units that I could exchange it for.  So I called customer service and got an RAN.  I am hoping when I get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that I don't have any more problems",0
electronics,5 of 8,2.0,Listen to the rest of us,"I have to say, since I really started listening to music I have payed attention to a lot more detail of sound.  With that said I am not a bass junky; but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound.  I currently owned a pair of Sony MDR-EX81LP (that cost me 30-40 dollars a year ago) I am a medical student and I study all day and all night, but cannot have my music blasting.  Conversely I needed to have a nice isolation of my sound.  Comparing my old Sony to the new ER-6 that I just got, I am EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with their performance.  I was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that I studied with my old ear buds. To be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling, they are noise reducing.  There is no component involved here, they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them.  My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it.  The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable; however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.  A combination of the two would be great.  Keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds.  Environmental sound reduction is great, sound quality is not as good as some others.....choose your fault and pay attention to pricing. ",0

Satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times I tried.  The display is excellent under sunny conditions.  Downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple.

electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great Speaker System ,"I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.",1

I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing ""Bourne Supremecy"" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.",1

It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you.

electronics,3 of 3,1.0,"If you like headaches and hassles, buy this router","This may be one of the cheapest routers out there, but it's cheap in every way. I spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas ""tech support"" whose expertise consisted of (barely) reading a script. Eventually these computer whizzes determined that my D-Link router didn't work. They told me to send it back (on my nickel, of course), and they sent me another one, which also did not work, at least not with my computer system. After more wasted hours, I was referred to the one guy at D-Link who--supposedly--has mastered this router's bugs. The problem? He never answered the phone. And despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk, he repeatedly returned my calls at 3:00 in the afternoon, the time when most people who can afford routers are working. Finally I had an epiphany: Life was too short to %*&#@ with D-Link. I packed up the router and sent it back to the CEO, Stephen Joe, with a letter. Then I went out and bought a Netgear router, and I was up and running in minutes. Mr. Joe never responded to my letter, but what else do you expect from a company that so clearly doesn't value its customers",0

electronics,,1.0,Not worth the hassle.,"From day one, back in late August 2006, I've had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn't work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it",0

It keeps getting twisted and I have marks on my shoulder from where it cuts in to it.  2nd, it's REALLY heavy.

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,A great Value,"Bought this DVD player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  It has many features and a good picture. You can't beat the large screen. I like the zoom feature especially. Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don't have a bulky protrusion when it's attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You'll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVD-RW or DVD+/- R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.  There is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold ""as-is"" but the unit I got was brand new and not refurbished. So far so good.  I don't thonk you will be disappointed",1

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Two Thumbs up for Quickcam Notebook Pro,"Notebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B",1
electronics,,2.0,Less than impressed,"The noise canceling is just barely discernible in comparison to when it is turned off and the music quality is not comparable to other earbuds in this price range ($60 list, $35 Amazon). The cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged, but I don't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into (combined with the stronger cord, better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears)",0

The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff?

I bought it primarily to use it as a good quality speaker-phone (with mute) for long conference calls.

I get caller-Id on all other phones in the house except this one. I have tried every possible varient (resetted settings, disconnected other phones, etc.) but nothing works: I always get ""NO ID MESSAGE"" on the LCD. The second major shortcoming is that called-parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone. One way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly, but that sort-of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone. Another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded-phone (hence will not work in case of emergencies). Finally, two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter. One good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good, has a professional appearance, and claims to have a duplex-speakerphone.",0

electronics,10 of 10,2.0,Great mechanics but the coffee taste is lost...really lost.,"We drink a lot of coffee all day, every day.  So we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher-tasting.  We first bought the 10-cup Capresso MT-500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly.  The coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great.  Unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it.  So instead of another expensive Capresso replacement, we decided to try a Japanese model which we thought might be more reliable.  We have been using the Zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly.  No leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the Capresso.  Unfortunately, there is no water filter system in this model compared to others (we had taken this for granted and not checked for it).  And no reuseable metal mesh filter (that I could find on the market) instead of paper filters.  The water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds.  We are not sure why our coffee just doesn't taste very good anymore, but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality.  Today, we pulled out our very old Krups ProAroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement.  We will use this and the Zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new Capresso coffeemaker replacement.  Don't waste your money on this Zojirushi model unless you don't care about taste.  It was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned.  Even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine",0

electronics,6 of 8,2.0,Barely gets the job done ...,"   My company car has a built-in GPS unit and I have gotten to like it, sort-of.  I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit.  After some research, the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $700.  The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package.   I use a PalmPilot, so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV.    Installation was quite awkward, and getting it up and running was a chore.   I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now.  It does do the job, fitfully, and has several glaring issues.  Most irritating, the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated.  If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected, the iQue 3600 makes you find the location.  But the address from the Palm section doesn't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address.  I'm left-handed and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward.  The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go, but my unit takes a good 5-10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky.   This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 5-10 minutes.  Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders.  Also, the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky.  This is OK, except that the iQue 3600 doesn't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed.  ",0

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great features,"My favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers (1-xxx-xxx-xxxx) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call.  My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxx-xxx-xxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first.  This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number.  I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in.  Very handy.  As far as being a phone, it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it",1

electronics,,1.0,This Apple product is rotten to the core!,"Bought these and used them once.  Had to remove them when I found myself in dire need of some Excedrin Migraine.  What do you get for your $39?  Cheap, tinny, bass-less sound that's like being plugged into a busted Walkman.  The buds themselves don't remain stable in the ear, so forget about using them while engaging in motion-involved activity (such as jogging, walking, head-bobbing, neck movement, etc).  These are by far the worst earbuds on the market.  How could Apple stoop so low?  Don't be fooled!  Do a Google search for these and you'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product.  You've been warned.",0

Recently, the sound is cutting out when communicating with my girlfriend across the country.  I think it might just be her interet connection though (we both have the same web cam).

Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys.  But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life",0

Picture quality is very good, and the desired basic features have functioned without problems.  In other words, in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player, quality and reliability have been high.  Price too was very reasonable.  That means durability is the last quality to consider, which is why I have given the player a 4 rather than a 5.  There is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years.

I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.

I was planning on using this for work, as I get a lot of DVD's from clients - so I popped one of those in and guess what?  It came up as ""invalid disc"".  It's supposed to play the majority of formats, and I triple checked the disc in my other dvd players, and it worked in my Panasonic DVD/VHS combo player.

It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus",0

However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don't know.  But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter.  Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don't buy the expensive ones",1

If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all.  I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk.

Since it was only $20, I just left it alone. Well...after going months without a gamepad, I decided to get another Logitech gamepad, the same one I had, and guess what.

I took it on our first trip to New York and Long Island and it was terrible. The first problem occurred on the New Jersey turnpike. I was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat. The unit said I was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway. However when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more. It said I was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70, and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere. I even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job. It did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 + miles from when it acted up. We even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again. About 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again. Then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going. We often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit. Then on the trip from the Bronx to Long Island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating. I had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone. However about 1 mile from their place it started working again. We used it on long island with no trouble at all. Then on  trip back to the Bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions. Then on our way back from the Bronx to long Island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating . The same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the Bronx. On our way back to Maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions. I did update the software to the new 1.2.0 days before we took the trip.  ",0

electronics,7 of 8,4.0,A Good Wireless Mouse for a Notebook but consider the Bluetooth option V270.,"The V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.",1

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Big Work Horse, Colors Just Right","Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128",1

I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. ",1

They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.

At first I thought the battery was dead, but a new battery didn't help.  The screen would flash on and then off.  It will not boot up.  Plugging it into the computer did no good, it could not be reconized or accessed.  It goes in the trash.  In addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored.  Also, the output volumn was to low.  I would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise, it wasn't up to the task.  Now it is landfill",0
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,weak sound unless you have a headphone amp,"The Koss Pro4AAT headphones are quality headphones, but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv.  To get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about, you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp.  Also, the ear pads are of a vinyl-like material which doesn't breathe well, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.  I've read that leatherette pads are available, but so far haven't been able to find them.  The warranty alone is great, but I wouldn't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp",0

I restart and it says my device is malfunctioning.  I manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again.  I try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network. I'm a network engineer and I am well versed in what I am doing, but this card has given me nothing but trouble. I had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect.  This only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing.  I talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor isn't supported, which is total BS and just an attempt to get out of supporting me, they wouldn't even let me return the product.

Additionally, gravity takes it down to the lower neck area in common use so that when the dog is doing normal dog things, the device sinks downward so that the antenna is pointing toward the ground.

When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it's home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30's as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT!!!",1

electronics,4 of 6,2.0,Frustrating Item,The first Vista Cx I purchased died after only 3 days of use. I returned it to Amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it.  The second unit lasted for 4 days until I fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket. Though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen. Garmin's claim of waterproofness for 1m for 10 minutes is utter baloney. The poorly designed T-style lock on the battery case cannot possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity. I probably wouldn't buy buy another Garmin but I'm stuck with them as I have already invested $200 in proprietary MapSource software.  I guess that was their plan.,0

I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration.

I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I'm very happy with this purchase.  I've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I'd definitely recommend this speaker set",1

These lasted about twice as long, before the battery life just became worthless. We are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time - say, 1 hour. And you can't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out, and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again. And yes, we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge, and all that kind of stuff. Still...I have never used a more frustrating phone, nor will I ever purchase an AT&T phone again.

Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.  A great buy for only 100 bucks!

These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.

electronics,4 of 4,1.0,NEW = worthless thieves!,"NEW are notorious thieves in the consumer electronics repair industry.  I personally submitted for repair both a $1,600 video camera (Sony DCR-PC5) and a car CD player (a Sony CDX-C90, a $1,200 in-dash top of the line unit.  If you've heard of it, you know what I'm talking about).  I was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera (some ambiguous statement about logic board, power unit, etc. failure followed), and would have to pay ~$780 to have it fixed.  I naturally refused, and was forced to keep my dead 4 month-old handycam, an unfortunate testament to some of Sony's now widely publicized QC issues.  The reason I did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my CD player.  I was told, explicitly, that if NEW could not fix it, they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of $1,000 (not even enough to cover the cost of the player).  As an added insult, when they indeed could not fix the unit, they KEPT it, and I NEVER received a check!!!  Simply outrageous!  Blatant theft, and I'm not the only one who will tell you a story about NEW and such an act.  They are IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of, and literally take your money and run/disappear.  Don't expect to ever hear from them, should your camera stop working, and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand.  Chances are, you will have to eat the loss, as I did.  This product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund.  I seriously thought it was a gag when I saw NEW was in charge of the coverage.  What a joke!  Whoever runs your company, NEW, ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused.

After doing online research about using the 30"" display under Windows XP, I found that the ""functional"" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides, I didn't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).",1
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent organizer!!,I was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both!! It's very easy to learn and enter stuff. I'm a first time PDA owner and this is an excellent product!,1
electronics,,5.0,Cruzer w/ Skins,Awesome product for the price.  You need to get a SMALL ring (like from a key fob from a car) to use it on your own key ring,1
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Don't overlook this player,"Earlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23"" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.",1
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great Printer for the Photographer,I love this printer. I purchased it to print 8X10s from my digital camera. The ink doesn't fade over time like my HP did.,1
electronics,7 of 12,4.0,increasing tech. data,"It would seem, even to a non-tech, that someone has switched your Uniden mobile/base tech. data around. Secondly, terms such as &quot;standard&quot; mean less than trustworthy when applied to sensitivity and selectivity. Please don't feel I berate these 2 fine products.However as I am a com/tech. I would like the actual bench test measurements for an informed recom/purchases.Also I would like to know If Cobra 1000 or 2000 series are availible as they still have the best selectivity and sensitivity that I have had on my bench yet.Thank Yo",1
electronics,,1.0,Junk,"The only thing this item is good for is charging your ipod.  The transmitter is so weak all you hear is static buzz with muffled music in the background.    Don't waste your money.  And, don't expect any help from the manufacturer who  refuses to answer emails or accept a warranty return.  ",0
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,If I knew then what I know now... I'd still buy it. ,"So, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. ",1
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Exacly As Expected,"The cups of these heaphone are a little small and they do fit snuggly on my head but after stretching them out a bit I must say they are very comfortable. If you dont like them at first wear them for a while, they will grow on you.",1

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Was unable to use,"I was not able to get this card working with my Win2K laptop. I'm no novice, have configured the rest of my wireless network without any problem, and have had a friend's Netgear card working in the same system. I called tech support and after working with me they said the card was defective and to send it back, which I did. However, I had the same problem with the replacement card. So, I can't recommend this product",0

electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Not for people with small heads...,"I purchased this unit not for gaming, but for making PC to PC calls.  Here are my observations:",0
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Wow!,"As long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.",1
electronics,5 of 5,2.0,Be wary.,"While certain labels with this software are much more easier to work with such as the CDs and the general labels, I found this product much less than satisfactory.  ",0
electronics,2 of 8,5.0,Outstanding,"JBL speaker system for IPOD is an outstanding product, I would highly recommend it",1
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Garmin Etrex Windshield Mounting Bracket,"Very strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you. Product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways. Otherwise, this is a well-designed and quality product",1
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Once it's on it may never come off.,"While I don't have any evidence to refute the package claim that it ""attaches to any notebook"",  once attached to my son's computer it was almost impossible to remove.  It took 10 minutes to get it off and we were pulling so hard I thought we would damage the computer.   We will be returning it.  Not recommended",0
electronics,,2.0,avoid if you live in or near a major city,"Like other fm transmitters I have tried, this one leaves much to be desired.  Living in a major urban area, I was unable to find any fm channel that did not produce significant static and generally poor sound quality. Product is easy to use, but I consider the sound quality unacceptable.",0
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,excellent product,This portable cd holder is perfect for me.  I work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym.  My cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd's.  I like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch.  I would recommend it to anyone,1
electronics,5 of 7,4.0,"It's not perfect, but it's very good","Pros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small",1
electronics,11 of 15,2.0,dwt108 double wide 108 disc dvd tower,Was a little hard putting it together.  You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart.  I am not happy with this product,0

electronics,,1.0,Threw it out.,"As best as I can tell the wires were too thin, and it could not handle any kind of bandwidth.",0
electronics,,4.0,Good,I bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren't that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. ,1
electronics,,1.0,Broke after a year.......,"At first it wasn't a bad unit.  But it broke within a year.  Now that I read the past reviews, I see I'm not alone....",0
electronics,9 of 11,2.0,Not working as well as I'd like,"I like this style of headphone radio (especially when I jog), and haven't found any similar models that I like. This is my third purchase of this radio.  Each of the three have had problems.  First died completely (although it was used a lot).  Second still works, but last number doesn't show up on digital display.  I wanted a backup in case second died, so I ordered another one.  This third works least well of all.  At times, entire display is off, radio doesn't work at all, or it won't change channels.  Then other times it worked. Seems like might be affected by heat outside. However, I know have another persistent problem.  That being, it won't let me program the preset stations.  Again, I'm limited in my choices, and I use this type headphone a lot.  So I suffer through poor quality",0
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,great mouse - esp. if you have carpel tunnel in shoulder,I got this mouse because I have developed carpel tunnel pain in my shoulder from years and years of mouse activity. I'm happy to say it is nearly gone (the pain) - I ordered one for my office and will now get one for home.  It does take a bit of getting used to (after years of movable mouse action) - but it can be done.,1
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,An Excellent Value!,"This was part of my Stereo update. I selected this receiver for quality, value and ease of operation. I matched it up with the Sony CDPCX355 300 CD player and a fresh pair of those Bose 301-V speakers. Years ago I used to be an audiophile and I now think I'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby",1
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,"Ok product, So-so design","It says the keyboard is supposed to be easier and more comfortable to type with. I don't think it is that comfortable. It's a little hard getting used to, so be prepared to hit the backspace a couple of times. The keyboard is 100mA and uses USB connection. There is a USB to PS/2 converter included. Overall, it is an ok product for the money, as it is the cheapest USB keyboard I've found",1
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,yes!,"i bought one version from best buy, then i bought another with different buttons, then i bought this platinum one because its so cool looking, just make sure you save the code",1

electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Good value,"I bought this based on the overall positive reviews.  Good sound quality, and a comfortable fit.  I didn't find them to be too tight at all.  For a low-end pair of headphones, I think they're pretty impressive",1
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect for all your mp3s!!!,"I used this card on my Nokia N70 for storing mp3 files. Granted I can't fit my entire music collection on it, but if I wanted to, I'd buy an iPod. This is perfect for listening to my favourite songs on the go, as well as taking pictures and video clips! Highly recommended",1
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,These DVD-Rs suck,"I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration",0
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,no technical support available,This product stopped working a few days after purchase.  5 phone calls and 2 emails were not returned by SanDisk.  This product did not work as advertised and no technical support of any kind is available.  I would not buy this brand again,0
