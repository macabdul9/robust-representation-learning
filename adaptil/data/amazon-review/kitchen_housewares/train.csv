For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker.  We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid).  Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.

After reading good reviews, I decided to purchase this kettle because I wanted something that would last with daily use. I disliked it from the beginning. Why? 1) It's heavy. 2) When you open the lid to fill it with water (you shouldn't fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter), water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle. 3) After less than 2 years of use, it is no longer working properly.

I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice &quot;measurements&quot; which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the &quot;keep warm&quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet &amp; mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice",0

I use it often, for grilled sandwiches, of course, but also for grilled meats and fish.  I would caution users to avoid meat with bones, e.g. lamb chops(you can't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill), and to be very careful about timing: things get done twice as fast!  While the cleaning ""comb"" is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill, you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately; much easier to do if the grill is warm (not hot).  I haven't tried grilling vegetables, yet, but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way, or eggplant, or peppers.",1

This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.  Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker.  Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it.  This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better.  On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket (mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium.

155,381,234,1752,kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very Pleased,"So far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine.  This is the first I'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don't.  The machine is very efficient.  You just put the mixture in and it does all the work.  You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others.  You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency.  I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn't thicken and I wasted all of it, so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine.  The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it, not as bad as I thought it would be though.  Overall, very happy",1

When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the ""dirt container"" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me ""Hoover"" spells ""DISAPPOINMENT""",0

As part of our initiation, pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers.  Each player had five glasses, and as he placed his marker, he would empty his glass.  The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses.  Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe, so really the point of the game, as with most fraternity games, was to see who could best hold his liquor.

Well, instead of making one, you have to roll three in enough time before it cools.  I tried numerous times to roll each one quickly as possible, but by the second one the third waffle is cooled and has not had the chance to be rolled up into a cone.  It really is not smart for the manufacture to sell this product, unless it comes with three cone makers to wrap the waffle in.  And, to state that you need three people to make it or it will not work.  Do not bother purchasing this product, unless you are an expert cone maker.  I did, however, went ahead and purchased the regular sized cone maker.  It is hard to perfect the perfect cone without having a hole at the bottom, but at least I have time to wrap up one cone at a time without having it cool on me to quickly.  Also, the petite cone waffle maker is rediculously too small to try to wrap.  It really is a waste of energy.

I've only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I'm more interested in function than appearance.

It came with a little scoopy to dig out your coffee beans and grinds.  At first it seems like a nice little unit.  I poured a pot of water into it in order to do away with any oils left over from manufacturing.  I say you should run 3 pots of water through it before use (filterless of course).  After a few uses, I noticed that the carafe does spill out onto the counter if you do not pour slowly.  If you want your coffee now and have no time to pour, don't get this item.  After having this machine for 3 weeks now, and using it constantly every morning, I have finally decided that it is near total crap.  I just made a pot of coffee this morning when the machine decided it would spurt some hot air &amp; water which caused the grinds blow all over the place.  Spilling out of the top onto the carafe and drooling hot coffee and grinds all over the counter.  How nice.  If you're going to buy a cheap coffee maker, spend the extra 5 or 6 dollars and get a semi-decent one.  Toastmaster should stick to toasting.

It has a small blade that cannot pull down anything of substance and I had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up -- just the bottom part of the mix spins around. I used this blender four times since August 2006 (when I bought it) to make 'smoothies', always with poor results. As the other reviewer said, the fruit stays lumpy. The little blades aren't strong enough. Yesterday I wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup. Of course they are thick and starchy, but after the usual 'stirring' to get them to move through the blender, the speed buttons started to vibrate and I could smell the unit getting hot. I wasn't overworking it -- mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds. All of a sudden, it wouldn't work any more. It just burned out. If you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things, don't buy this blender. I'm going to see if Amazon will take it back. (Note: after I wrote this, I was told by Amazon that I had to get in touch with the manufacturer, which I could do because it was within 90 days of purchase. However, the company wants me to mail in the plug and $5 for 'shipping' to get a replacement, which obviously I don't want. Why would I want to pay $5 more for a product that didn't work the first time? Why would I want the product again at all? Amazon would have taken it back, but they wanted it returned in the box, which I threw out. I'm even more dissatisfied with this product now than when I wrote this review originally.

These cracks developed very soon after I bought them, and I only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher. Because of the design of the cups, it's kinda annoying to wash them by hand - and they're not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason.

It is far too complicated and has too many pieces that have to be washed each time it is used and then put back together again.  One can expect to spend about 30 minutes to disassemble and reassemble the unit while following the assembly guide. In addition to that drawback, there isn't anything that should be placed in a dishwasher, so it has to be hand-washed and hand dried. An osterizer would be a much simpler and better choice!!!",0

No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice (""rice cooker cup"")than it does for the water (""regular measuring cup""), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.",0

This is an excellent buy for several reasons. First, it is sleek and stylish, especially given its neutral color.  Second, it provides a great wind speed given its small size.  Third, it provides a constant soothing wind sound, which is great for drowning out any annoying pheripheral noises.  Lastly, I have not seen the product in a retail store any cheaper than on Amazon.com.  We have had the product over 8 months with nightly use with no sign of defficiency in performance",1
732,1181,757,1140,kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Don't use with batteries!,"The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.",0

741,683,1304,73,kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,Totally Worth It!,"After reading all the reviews and hearing about this on the radio, I went ahead and shelled out $100 for this.  I had really high expectation, having never spent so much for a heater before.  I have happy to say that I am completely satisfied.  This heater doesn't overwhelm and dry out the room with too much heat.  Instead it circulates the heat over time (you should probably give it a good half hour to properly heat the whole room) evenly heating the whole room and leaving absolutely no cold spots.  After spending some time in my room, I had completely forgotten how cold it was outside.  Other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be.  My only minor complaint is that for its price, it should have included a remote control.  Otherwise, it is a wonderful heater",1

(Look at the product image enlarged) Most things I cook take 6 hours on low!  I occasionally have something that needs 8 hours but most of the time it is 6 to 7 hours.  Unfortunately, if it doesn't do the time you need, it is completely useless.  You would have to be home to turn it off or down.

I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade.

He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring, then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov.  I've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk don't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further.  I can't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position... to scape or to add ingredients. I like to make crepes, which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating. It's impossible with this machine. I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl, unmixed... and the batter is full of lumps.  If I want to scape the bowl, (which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk doesn't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time, and even then, with the paddle or whisk attached, it's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back. You can't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely. You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand. This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver. It's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter. The speeds are not variable enough. It seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out. ",0

It's not much louder than most microwave ovens and it's far less likely to burn the popcorn. Only one minor complaint: butter doesn't really melt completely in the cup on top (make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it). An on/off switch might've been nice but that's not a big deal unless you want to keep it on your countertop permanently.

My ony complaint is that it's rather large for the size of my kitchen. Excellent waffles! Thick and golden, like in the user submitted photos.

It takes way too long to grind, whether pulsing or grinding continuously. And then the grounds are very uneven. Although the manufacturer says it is grinding slowly to keep the flavor in, every coffee expert I've consulted with says the longer coffee grinds, the more it heats up and the more flavor is lost. Even after long grinding, there are large pieces of bean still visible. I was also excited about the machine's detachable bowl, which does make for easy cleaning. But only of the bowl. The rest of the machine is a pain to clean and no matter how carefully you remove the top, your counter is covered in grounds. I bought a second bowl so that I could grind spices in the same machine, and I think the coffee grinder works better on spices and seeds (such as flax) than it does on coffee. But you still have to clean the entire thing before reusing it, or your spices have a strong coffee flavor from the grounds that are stuck to the protective case. (That plastic case does make grinding quieter, however.) All in all I'm quite disappointed with this purchase. I should have gone farther upscale and gotten a more serious burn grinder, or stuck with my cheap Krups with the slanted bowl base which made even grounds quickly.",0

In 2003, I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears. Before I purchased these, I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears, and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked. I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan, even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China. After over a year of using these, I am quite impressed with them. The handles are very comfortable, and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears. Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often. Also, the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears.

Motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order; the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2-3 months in a storage building. The motor on the Cuisinart is still going strong, but I had to trash it today.  I have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1-3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight,  but that's to be expected with a blade grinder.  The on/off button broke about 2 months ago; then, last week, the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite John Conti beans.  Others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models, but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee!

I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the four-slice setting.

And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler.  Poor design flaw.  I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You'll notice in OXO's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up.  Why?  Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way.  Hey OXO, that's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar! ",0

There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface ""patina"" builds up that is quite non-stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned-on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build.  Le Creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick.  The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating.  I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations.  If you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems.",1

When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all",0

The tray that slides back and forth with the food has a stainless top that is literally two-faced taped onto the plastic base. This was very poor from a quality standpoint, and came off in my hand the first and only time used. The plastic base for this tray has about fifty little half inch square honey-comb sort of areas that grease from meat or juices from food WILL get down into.

1222,1933,398,975,kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,I can finally make proper pancakes,"I'm glad I bought this griddle! I've been stuck with teflon-coated nonstick pans for a while, and when I saw such great deals on cast iron pans, I had to buy a few. I ordered the griddle, the ~10"" Logic grill pan, and the ~10"" skillet. Thankfully all three qualified for free Super Saver shipping, because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves! The order was placed late Monday night, and I was promised that my pans would ship by the following Monday. By Wednesday the griddle had arrived, and the grill pan showed up on Friday. Way to go, UPS! It turns out that its good to get these things early, because it takes a few days to get the ""natural finish"" pans properly seasoned. I think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly. Food won't stick to a cast iron pan if you've taken the time to season it until it's black and almost totally non-stick. It takes some time and paitence, but it's the same way with a good wok: you get out of it what you put into it, and this certainly reflects in one's cooking. Iif you're going to buy one of these pans, DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Ask Google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan. If you want to save some time, just buy the Logic line of pans, because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase (the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original). Keep in mind that you will eventually have to re-season the pan, but hopefully not for a while (we'll see how the grill pan turns out).",1

Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots & pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell.  The newer pots & pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom.  So, their quality is less than it was; most people who ""grew up with Farberware"" may not realize this.  Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers.  Also note: if you are buying a 12"" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section.

No, it isn't restaurant quality, and yes, if you put these through the dishwasher they'll tarnish and probably even start to rust (any metal designated as ""stainless"" is rust resistant rather than rust proof, and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably aren't treating their knives very well).  As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking, but doesn't always have the time for it, these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality.  Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening - I've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely - and should probably be hand-washed for longest life.  With that little bit of maintenance, however, this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs (it meets all of mine, but then I don't often dress poultry, filet my own fish, or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife) for quite a nice price",1

I chose this one after reading all the online reviews, and even though I saw that a few people found it slow, I was not prepared for how slow it really is! I just sifted 3+ cups of confectioner's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes. As another reviewer said, in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired. (I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before, fer' pete's sake!!!) I'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter. I'm stuck with the thing now, I suppose, so I'll learn to just go slower. But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side. The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I'm surprised nobody else has come up with. But that doesn't redeem the product for me.

The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT.

The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish.  For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work.  The real drawback is the length.  When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7"" in diameter.  This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies.

I assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that I gave away. The first time I used it (as soon as it got up to tempurature) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top. Then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter. The lid is the worst! At first I thought maybe I was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid. Now I realize this is the way it was designed! I made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid. The only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter. Not to mention its probably a fire hazard. I don't think my paper towel idea is what Rival had in mind when they designed this! I wish I could return this but I threw away the receipt.    ",0

You have no need to change your grip until you're through blending--which is next to no time.  It blends thoroughly and efficiently.  It does have enough weight to give you some control.  You wouldn't want something this powerful to be too light--it could just fly out of your grasp.  This feels solid, is very attractive, and also appears to be very well made.  I love it.

Light also not that bright.,"Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light",0

I stumbled across this item looking for cookware.  I read all the reviews, thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!!!  And so is my family.  The day we received it, I cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack.  Extremely easy.  All I needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me.  Since then, we have cooked more muffins, a meatloaf, bacon, toast, english muffins, chicken strips, waffles and bratwurst.  My kitchen doesn't heat up like when I use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven.  It was so easy for my husband to use this also while I was shopping and I just gave him a 15 second class before I left.  I didn't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods.  This is my first Convection Toaster oven, which has replaced the microwave and toaster, and I can assure you we expect to use this oven alot.  I love the design, the warming tray does just that, even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm.  It's great! The oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality.  I received my machine really quickly and that's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification.  Speaking of gratification, I could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine.  All the reviews are true. It's perfect, once you read the instructions or perhaps do as I did, get a walk-thru from the wonderful folks at DeLonghi customer support, you will be up and running in no time.  You can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care (read the instructions) will last a very long time.  The espressos I've made so far are supreme, even my 14 year old loved a weak one I made for him; and it's so easy after set-up to use.  It could not be any simpler.  Who would not love this machine?  There was one website that was charging $1200 for the same machine.  I could not believe my eyes.  The only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine.  I really could not see what he was talking about.  It has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam (it makes very creamy foam) it will increase the volume 2-3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk.  But there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother.  They had me worried when I read that but the frother does its thing with total ease.  Even a caveman could do it.  You stick it in the milk and turn the switch and, voila!, it's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and can't accomodate the foam it creates.  All in All, this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise.  This machine delivers, I love it and so will you",1

I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out.  When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot.  I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say.  I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up.  In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non-stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily.  If you get the Calphalon One Infused-Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service.  Remember the old saying ""you get what you pay for.""

The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a ""Good Grip,"" which is ironic since it's called the ""OXO Good Grips"" oven mitt.  It's hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you're trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan).  It's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven.

To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, ""no messy ice"". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don't really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink.

Not too long ago I recently acquired the Calphalon grill pan because my Foreman grill is too small if I want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time. Plus the black coating on my Foreman grill is wearing out. So I bought the Calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store. I haven't been able to get enough of it. It is so easy to clean even when I had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in Italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed, garlic, shallots, and extra virgin olive oil. The marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn't non-stick. I also like using the Calphalon grill pan because I can cook both the meat and vegetable (say asparagus) at the same time. The results are fabulous. I get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste.

But that's my fault.  The Crystal Aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water, but overall, the quality of the coffee it produces is merely OK.  ",0

I have re-ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results.  They say they are ""microwave safe"" but after the first few uses, the dish heats up to the point of burning your hand (or worse yet the unsuspecting hand of your child or guest!) and the food/liquid inside stays cold.  I am SO disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes",0

I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea.  So far it has held up great.  This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.",1

First the handle stuck while I was kneading dough and I barely was able to pry it off.  Then I had problems with the stem.  When I tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested I buy a new Cuisinart!  Stay away from Cuisinart!  I'm looking into Kitchen Aid for my new processor,0

1986,230,1995,1446,kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,4.0,"So Far So Good, Handle a little narrow","I never really noticed the inner groove as a ""problem"" until I read the other reviews. This was part of my first All-Clad set--so nice! Yes, things stick in the groove, but I just use a silicone spatula while cooking and I don't seem to have a problem.  I love the capacity and size/shape of this unit. Scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot, as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting. But sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if I'm not diligent about stirring out the groove. The width/depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work. ",1

But mine came off color (sorta transparent) at the corners (and this wasn't a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets) but still good value - not worth exchanging so I kept them. I guess mine look unique,1
1988,960,1148,177,kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,West Bend Triple Timer,"I used a West Bend Triple timer for about 25 years and was well satisfied with it. It had a loud alarm. The new model has a clock (not very useful), a stop watch function (moderately useful) and a triple timer function (fairly useful). Unfortunately the timer functions are more difficult to set than on the older unit. The alarm is very weak, very difficult for me to hear. I am looking for another alarm.",0

However, I used them for the first time last night at a dinner party and the bottoms of the plates and cups are so rough they scratched my solid oak, espresso stained table!  Each place a cup or plate was set that wasn't on a placemat there were small scratches left behind. If you always use a table cloth or have a granite or stone table they would be fine, but I wouldn't ever put them on a quality wood table again. Fortunately Amazon makes returning easy",0
1990,1668,1893,1334,kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Best purchase I have made,"We love this thing.  The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board.  We have a small house and not alot of wiggle room, so space saving is key for us. Also,I hate ironing; sleeves, collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear.  With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie.  On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing. ",1

I love cooking with them and when my last one simply wore out from so much use, I bought this one. What a mistake. After only minimal use, the middle of the pan began to burn extra hot and all the food was sticking and burning. Then the coating began to peel from the pan. The middle began to buldge slightly so the surface was not flat for even frying. What a nightmare!! This pan was less then two months old! And I do know how to treat and cook with electric skillets - just in case you were thinking I did something to cause this. I have never been so disappointed in a product before. However, it did have a new place in our home - the trash can. Guess I should have read the reviews first. Now that was my mistake!!",0

We have only used it for parmesan cheese, and so far we've had no problems.  It works great so far",1

Also, I have cut my pizzas on this pan and there was barely a scratch on it.  Very heavyweight with no warping.  What a buy! ",1
