"this review is for the uk dvd three - disc box set. disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior, chasing jamie and fast and curious. disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special, falling in lust again and love potion no. 10. the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom, she's the boss and legally yours. why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material. < br / > < br / > each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe ( lauren hayes ) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. for instance, model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew ; falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel ; she's the boss is about a put - upon male secretary / dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex. < br / > < br / > it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. finally, the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel, singer island, florida although my map of florida shows no singer island. the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned. this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release. 4 stars.",0,1,0.44802653789520264

"if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina. what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci - fi film around a sexy statuesque female android? surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise. firstly, this is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. secondly, the title character is woefully underused. this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film. i don't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. anyway, what we are left with is a whole lot of mind - numbing comedy relief, which often is made up of hopeless spoof - type gags of the big sci - fi hits of the time such as alien, star wars and 2001. it's badly written and not funny at all, and it doesn't even really have a plot to propel things along. the story basically is about a police space - cruiser that is sent to get a rock. that's it! steven spielberg once said that a high - concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence. what he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe? < br / > < br / > this seemed like a sure - fire winner to me but it failed miserably. it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been. a barbarella for the 80's this ain't. < br / > < br / > shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way. and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest. i just think it's a great shame that dorothy didn't have a better film left to immortal",0,1,0.5038365721702576
"the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor - - the secret of their success, you might say. but galaxina is quite uniquely different - - it is mst3k's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional * and * the unintentional humor alike fall flat. < br / > < br / > it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail - - and the reasons are quite varied. sometimes it's a timing question ; sometimes it's a good idea badly worked out ( the human restaurant * could * have been hilarious, but it wasn't ) ; sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room, with the punchline ending up on the floor ; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus. it's harder to figure out why galaxina doesn't get any laughs on that count. something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, just as something is wrong ( not at all subtly ) with the intentional humor. it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is. it's absolutely unique in my experience.",0,1,0.49616342782974243

"it's true that "" they died with their boots on "" gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer's ( errol flynn ) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn. because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us - american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse ( anthony quinn ) in a favorable light. i'm almost tempted to say that "" little big man "" in its unqualified anti - custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison. further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture this isn't just a movie about the battle of the little big horn, it's a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet, the famed civil war hero, the indian fighter, and, last but not least, the husband. < br / > < br / > the movie begins with custer's time at the west point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. during a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, elizabeth bacon ( olivia de havilland ), who, like custer himself, is a native of monroe, michigan. custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away. custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg. while on leave, he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth, who promises him her hand in matrimony. immediately after the war, custer and elizabeth bacon are married. < br / > < br / > with the civil war over, custer is demoted, doesn't get a real command, and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small, professional american army. as he starts to drink, his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general - in - chief winfield scott. custer is given the command of the us 7th cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties. custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horse's cause, but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of",1,1,0.48536422848701477

"the saving grace of this film is its humour. playing up to the strengths of their star, warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism ; it was robin hood all over again, and flynn blossomed in the role. all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception. < br / > < br / > it also benefits from the return of former co - star olivia de havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership ; the part of strong - minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love - interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynn's later films, and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. in this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled - - for once, she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect. < br / > < br / > the flynn / de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability, when most of flynn's other westerns - - held in such affection by the contemporary american public, although allegedly not by their star - - have long since been forgotten. the action scenes are fairly cursory ( despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges ) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy - fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. it cuts down on the cast list, but it's a trifle too morally convenient. < br / > < br / > however, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players ( memorably including anthony quinn in an all - but - wordless role as the sioux leader ), errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal : charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash - point indign",1,1,0.5052834153175354

"i first saw this film two years ago in the cinema, and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step - mother. their relationship with their step - mother is strained to say the least, with the step - mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. the film though slants with oriental style ghost effects and horror, which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear, but is all the more intriguing. < br / > < br / > the direction is incredibly good, and the acting is stunning, with the step - mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. the large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. this film to me clearly shows why korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. you simply don't get anything like this in the western world, sadly, and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade. < br / > < br / > highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare...",1,1,0.49537765979766846
"i just saw "" a tale of two sisters "" last night and really enjoyed it. i've been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea. there aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film, but the director does maintain the off - kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's "" there's something under the bed "" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. he's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make - up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv. i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you. < br / > < br / > major spoilers ahead ( do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed ) i was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. however, i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. the film is very much like "" the machinist "" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions. < br / > < br / > here's my interpretation of the film. the su - yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su - mi or the actual ghost of su - yeon that only su - mi can see and interact with. the initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of su - mi. there is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. i believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. the stepmother before that point is imagined by su - mi ( perhaps part of her split personality? ) that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy",1,1,0.5046223402023315
"this review is long overdue, since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post - production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film - making. it's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "" masterpieces. "" < br / > < br / > the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute. quite literally, ji - woon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels. a seemingly insignificant object may be shown a rack of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack, a bottle of pills, etc. but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene ( or perhaps the movie in total ), which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront. such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie, but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid - fire, relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness, lest they miss something important. in other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? it's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable. < br / > < br / > the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode, who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent, unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. he posits that ji - woon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. in reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film. if our good friend za",1,1,0.5317659974098206

"radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, was the right thing to do. the viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done. the adversity that coach jones and radio both faced was both tragic and predictable. people did not understand ; nor did they want to understand. but in the end, the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened. radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little, besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature : intuition, compassion, and love. coach jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how. it was sad the way coach jones and radio met. the practical joke that terrified the life out of radio was enough to make you want to severely punish, not only the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. however, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies. this movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed. ed harris was his usual brilliance. gooding was flawless. radio is an inspiration.",1,1,0.4962797164916992

"i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. what's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. the story is non - existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. the pace in languid and the settings are exotic. the film has a lot going for it. unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. according to imdb, al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen. < br / > < br / > the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick : our young blonde couple are picked - up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross - dresser! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (! ) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid - air. and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! i kid you not. ridiculous. we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. while the footage rolls, al and annie start making out. this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. watching the footage of the cross - dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly. < br / > < br / > speaking of drag, another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his",1,1,0.5245800614356995

"alfred hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty - one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it certainly isn't a bad film, he does appear to be right. that being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among hitchcock's best work. that's certainly not to say that it isn't good, it's just more than a little overindulgent, and that drags it down. hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. some of these dragged out sequences, such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in, but for every restaurant scene, there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse. < br / > < br / > the plot follows a middle - aged doctor and his wife that go to morocco for a holiday with their young son. while there, they meet a french man on the bus and another middle - aged couple in a restaurant. however, things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him. the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it, and it manages to hold this all the way through. in fact, i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made. like most of hitchcock's films, this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. there is also more than a little humour in the movie, which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on, and actually works quite well. < br / > < br / > the original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre. this film doesn't benefit from his presence, unfortunately, but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart, and doris day. james stewart is a man",1,1,0.5181888937950134

"the storyline of the milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong. now 50 years old, minako obha ( yuko tanaka ) lives alone and works two jobs one as a checkout clerk in a supermarket, the other as a milklady, doing her daily round on the hills of nagasaki. one of her stops is at the house of kaita takanashi ( ittoku kishibe ), a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife yoko ( akiko nishina ). minako and kaita used to see each other as school children, but after the death of minako's mother and kaita's father, who it seems were having an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. lying in her sick bed, yoko knows however that her husband's feelings for the milklady aren't completely gone and, for the sake of kaita after she has died, she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together. < br / > < br / > while the story might be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie. the film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of dementia. in the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships form, and how past and present can collide. the director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style. it's only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written. it's all validated by the emotional depths the film touches, represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of yuko tanaka.",1,1,0.4856046140193939

"if you need that instant buzz that only late 60s / early 70s euro sex movies can give off, then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother lode! subsequent tv director schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn ( of the soft core variety ) may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of tinto brass, jess franco and joe d'amato for a loop. radley metzger sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this marvelously twisted little number for us distribution through his company audubon. gorgeous cinematography ( favouring symmetrical compositions ) may elicit cries of'pretentiousness'from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone's backyard. hey, as far as i'm concerned, it's their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so, well, twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen! dagmar lassander ( immortalized as the gone to seed landlady from lucio fulci's house by the cemetery ) has never looked more exquisite than she does here, subtly portraying the innocent (? ) researcher held hostage by mad medic philippe leroy ( with all the art - house favorites to his name, you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c. v. ) as their initially violent'relationship'turns to s & m - tinged love story. nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. i for one was completely baffled and enchanted by the way schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during one scene ( i'll let you find that one out for yourselves... ) and lassander's gauze - clad boogie to an impossibly groovy 60s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of sylvia kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her emmanuelle days. you may not know this film just yet, but trust me, once seen you'll never forget it!!!",1,1,0.5154561400413513

"i had a great time watching femina ridens a couple of mornings back, somewhat hungover. for most of the film its pretty much a two hander, showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor philipe leroy and stunning dagmar lassander. i'd seen her before in a couple of fulci films dying gruesome deaths, but here she is young hip and beautiful. the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front, but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel. the set design, music, lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties italian style, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. both leads are pretty good, and it bears repeating that dagmar lassander is really, really fine. the music, by stelvo cipriani is gnarly too, perfectly suited to the images. director pierro schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here, but its not perfect. though very alluring, there's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be. i guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but i can't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze, more threat, that sorta thing, especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen. this is i suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity. its more of a light, fun pop art affair, lovable but insubstantial, like bubble bath. recommended mainly for those fond of the 60's, dagmar lassander, or sweet set designs.",1,1,0.4715094566345215

"i just saw this film again, i believe for the sixth time. i will doubtless see it many more times. this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made. although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, gilles mimouni. for ten years he has not made another film, and this was his only one. the story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly paying homage continually to both hitchcock and buster keaton. the split - second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on keaton in'steamboat bill junior ', and he is only not killed by inches. in this film, people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares, and if they had been one second off, they would have collided. the storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, or you will miss something crucial. the haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by peter chase is reminiscent of hitchcock's'vertigo ', and the whole film has the same eerie quality, but whereas hitchcock had one woman be two women, mimouni has two women be one woman, thereby inverting the plot structure. there are passing references to other hitchcock films, but it is'vertigo'which is central to the inspiration of this film. the theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. everything is hyper - charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. that is why it is so easily transferable from lisa to alice, when it is realised that it is alice who is more mysterious than lisa, and it is alice who truly embodies the eternal mystery. the film is ultimately'made'by romane bohringer. she is so fascinating that she outshines monica bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that bellucci is a knockout beauty, whereas bohringer is what the english call'plain '. however, romane bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the art of'personality dominance ', whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because romane is being",1,1,0.4988707900047302
"apartmente'l is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen. i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite. that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. as of now i haven't rewatched the movie and i don't think i will. < br / > < br / > the story follows the experiences of a man, max, who is engaged to be married to muriel. he remembers his old girlfriend lisa ( he considers this the love of his life ) as he listens, by accident, to lisa talking on the telephone. thus he tries to find lisa. here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa. there are many layers to this movie. there are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion. the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. the main character, max, has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect. i don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice. < br / > < br / > the character of alice is even worse. her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers ( that is the point, i guess ). the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character. it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. in the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. the ending lends a cynical touch. because it seems as if max's love for alice is temporary and fake. it is as if to say that love in",1,1,0.5011292099952698

"when i watched l'appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed : "" how complicated! "" and she is right, of course. when you are used to simple, one - linear plots, especially violent hero vs crook schemes, l'appartement is hard to follow. a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points. other whine about the confusing flash backs. come on! this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. < br / > < br / > the first 3 / 4 of the movie centers about the question : why did max and lisa split? the film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. having experience with french movies, i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right. in the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that max and lisa were manipulated by alice. max did not know, that lisa had left and why. lisa did not know, why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to paris. the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. < br / > < br / > after both max and lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes : can alice's manipulations be undone? well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed. < br / > < br / > many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy. there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two ( or more ) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. l'appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. in the first half alice seems to be a side character ; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure. < br / > < br / > acting is simply great. vincent cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from",1,1,0.5058404207229614

"i saw bandit queen in 2005, over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in india. the language, the stark treatment and the natural acting ( by a relatively unknown cast for that time ) might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema. the film, the cast, and shekhar kapoor, deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort. < br / > < br / > the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india. in fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. the reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this, and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen, and survived to tell the tale. survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. phoolan devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994. < br / > < br / > the film scores on several counts. the cinematography is brilliant. the music is apt. the cast, many of whom became more familiar names later, is very good. but the screenplay is patchy. things move too fast and in jerks at times. it's understandable though, because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive. or maybe i felt that because i have read mala sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though obviously not as shocking as the visual, account of phoolan devi's travails, and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film. < br / > < br / > there are some factual ambiguities too. according to phoolan devi, she wasn't present when the behmai massacre took place, and despite claiming to be the dictated account of phoolan herself, she is shown to participate, and in fact initiate, the massacre. then the final scene where phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the chief minister, while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of mahatma gandhi. symbolic value only, but shows that phoolan didn't want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to arjun singh, who many remember was the cm of madhya pradesh then. < br / > < br / > but these",1,1,0.4790070354938507

"it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and, when she did finally see parts of it, was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself. i do not know whether it was shown at all or not, but given her standing at the time as a rising politician, i doubt it. since then, i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days, and has gone into hiding as a result. < br / > < br / > her own concerns aside, this is an excellent film, made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach ; none of the rose - tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film. it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant : it's a true story. her misgivings are, it seems, not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her.",1,1,0.49193891882896423

"' oppenheimer'with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as evard teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest. well written, well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative, and very entertaining. the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2, and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los alamos and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project. the only downside is that this is a british production, and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent. ( the skill of current day australian & irish actors taking on non - native dialects is amazing. ) the storyline is fully consistent with richard rhodes'definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. sadly, the mini - series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion. < br / > < br / >'oppenheimer'compares favorably to the more recent'fat man & little boy'feature film with paul newman as leslie groves ( the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered ) and dwight schultz ( alumnus of tv's'a - team') as oppenheimer. as a mini - series,'oppenheimer'is around 4x as long as the newman feature, but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage.",1,1,0.4977269768714905
